# Configuring issue trackers

You can configure an issue tracker to be used with Dentest. This will allow you to synchronize the scenarios you
defined in Dentest directly inside your tickets description.

For now, only Jira is supported.

To configure a new issue tracker for your organization, as an admin of the organization, click on the "Administrate issue trackers" button.

Then, click on the accurate "Add configuration" button, and fill the form with the requested data. Then, hit "Save configuration" and you're all set.

If you need to remove it, just go back to this page and click on the accurate "Delete configuration" button.
