# Administration

All the administration tasks, either for organizations or projects, can be done at the root page of the entity you'd
like to administrate. Of course, you must be administrator to perform these tasks.

## Renaming

To rename an organization or a project, just click on its title and update it.

:::caution
Changing a title will also change the resource's URL.
:::

## Deleting

To delete an organization or project, click on the red button inviting you to delete it.

All of the resource's contents will be permanently deleted, and if it's an organization, all its project will be erased. 
So please ensure you really want to do that. We don't keep any backup, so we won't be able to restore your 
organization or project.

## Changing a project's visibility

A small button indicates the visibility of your project. Depending on its color and text, the project is either public, internal or
private. Clicking on the button will change the visibility.

## Users

You can access the list of users of your project or organization by clicking on the "Administrate users" button.

### Adding users

To add new users to your project or organization, just search for their username in the input field at the top of the 
list.

:::info
When you want to add users to an organization's project, you'll only be able to look for the users who belong to the 
organization. Which means that if you want to add to your organization's project a user who is not in the organization, 
you will have to invite this user to the organization first.
:::

In the list of users who belong to your organization or project, you can also change their permissions.
