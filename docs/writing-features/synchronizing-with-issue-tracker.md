# Synchronizing the feature with an issue tracker

If an issue tracker has been configured within your organziation, you can, when your feature is in draft mode, link it to an
issue on this tracker. All you have to do is filling the "Link XXX issue" input with the link to the issue.

Once an issue has been linked, you can click on the "Sync to XXX" button. This will update the ticket's description with your
scenarios.

When the feature isn't in Draft mode, the issue buttons are transformed into links towards the issue itself.
